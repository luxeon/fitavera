# Fitavera CRM — Open-Source Fitness Club Management & Booking System

## Development is in progress, product is not released yet!

**Fitavera CRM** is a free, open-source CRM and scheduling platform designed for fitness clubs, studios, and gyms. It helps automate client bookings, manage class schedules, and handle payments — solving real-world problems faced by gym owners and personal trainers.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Multi-location support:** Manage multiple clubs and locations (tenants) under one system.
- **Class scheduling:** Create fitness classes with time slots, capacity limits, and multiple instructors.
- **Online bookings:** Clients can view schedules and book or cancel classes online.
- **Smart cancellation rules:** Prevent last-minute cancellations (e.g., less than 4 hours before a class).
- **Client invitations:** Easily invite clients via email to join your club.
- **Payment tracking:** Set up pricing plans and manage client payments based on the number of sessions.
- **Instructor management:** Assign instructors to any session.
- **Visit monitoring:** Track attendance, skipped sessions, and notify clients about their remaining visits.

## 🧠 Why Fitavera CRM?

Many fitness club owners still rely on paper lists, spreadsheets, or messaging apps to manage bookings. That creates confusion, especially when:

- A class is limited to 10 clients, and you need to manually track who is attending.
- A client tries to cancel minutes before class, but your cancellation policy doesn’t allow it.
- You need to track payments and visits manually across locations and staff.

**Fitavera CRM automates these tasks and gives you full control.**
